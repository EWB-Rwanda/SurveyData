# The Purpose
Analyzing survey data from surveys handed out to communities in Rwanda.  The data is to help EWB-CU Rwanda understand our impact in the communities we work in and how to better work with and understand the needs of those communities.

# Where to Start
Start with the reports!  There you will find everything laid out nicely.  The reports could be improved upon if we found new ways to understand the data or if we expanded to include data from other years.

# More information
The folders contain the code used to find the survey data.  If you would like more information on where the data comes from or what it looks like, please see the reports for contact information.
