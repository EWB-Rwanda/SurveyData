# The Purpose
Analyzing survey data from surveys handed out to communities in Rwanda.  The data is to help EWB-CU Rwanda understand our impact in the community and how to better work with and understand the needs of those communities.


# Where to Start
Start with the reports!  There you will find everything laid out nicely.  The reports include graphs, what we could potentially improve as found in the surveys, and other analysis.

# More information
